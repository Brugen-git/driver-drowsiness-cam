# Driver-Drowsiness-Cam

In this project, we attempt to build a driver drowsiness detection system, which is an automobile safety technology. Road accidents are unfortunate incidents that cause adverse damage to human lives and the drowsiness of drivers while driving. In the field of accident prevention systems, detection of drowsiness, that is a state near to sleep, at the wheel becomes a primary arena of focus. With long drive hours, lack of sleep and continuous driving can become tiresome leading to lack of attention and alertness of the driver. An intelligent system can be developed to prevent fatigue related accidents and the driver can be observed in real time to detect the facial features and process the input to detect for fatigue and generate an alert for the driver to prevent any unfortunate incident. The system of drowsiness detection can include three subsystems: acquisition system, processing system and warning system which work in a pipeline sequence to avert accidents.
